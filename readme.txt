Request a review for WooCommerce shops is triggered automatically once a user makes a purchase via email.

Random text section added, so you have a few paragraphs and distribute them site-wide via an easy to use shortcode.

WP Social SEO gives you the ability to quick add your Social Profiles & reviews in a compliant way so that it shows up in a google search.

Specify your social profiles to Google. Use markup on your official website to add your social profile information to the Google Knowledge panel in some searches. Knowledge panels can prominently display your social profile information.

This is great for SEO, as it adds a lot of unique, random high quality text on a per page basis --> quality content, that Search Engines love, without creating 4 different widget areas. Everything is contained within that one widget.

One widget, means faster page loads compared to having 3 or 4 different widgets loading on the same page.
